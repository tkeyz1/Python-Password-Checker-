## Python-Password-Checker

## 🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a Python-based password strength checker that evaluates the security of user-entered passwords. The tool analyzes key factors such as length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and common patterns to determine the strength level. This project aims to promote secure password practices and provide instant feedback for improving weak credentials.

### 🧠 Skills Learned

- Python programming fundamentals

- Working with string methods and regular expressions

- Implementing password validation logic

- Building user-friendly terminal interfaces

- Encouraging secure authentication practices

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Usage

- I developed and tested the project using Visual Studio Code. After writing the script (password_checker.py), I opened the working directory directly in VS Code.

- I used the integrated terminal (Ctrl + ~) to execute the script by running:

  . bash
  . Copy
  . Edit
  . python password_checker.py
  . Tested Passwords

- I entered different sample passwords into the terminal to see how the checker evaluated them based on:

  . Length

  . Use of uppercase and lowercase letters

  . Digits and special characters

  . Avoidance of common weak patterns

- I Analyzed the Feedback,script provided instant feedback by classifying each password as Weak, Moderate, or Strong, along with improvement suggestions.
